                Based out of Bolivia, we have access to the most <b>exotic lumber</b> in the South American Bolivian jungle. We are a small family run lumber provider and strive to provide both quality and low prices. We are able to achieve this through making sure that our products are treated with the care and attention needed to keep the wood from being damaged. Additionally, our small but agile team is able to keep prices low with minimal overhead. If you want to look at our product offerings, please go to the inventory page. Our inventory will continue to grow to provide clients with whatever lumber/look is needed.
